readme for Yan's MPD RT enchancements

To enable RT mpd.conf needs the following paragraph added:

realtime_option {
	memlock			"yes"
	stack_reserve		"1024"
	heap_reserve		"10240"

	main_priority		"OTHER:0"
	player_priority		"FIFO:32"
	decoder_priority	"FIFO:31"
	update_priority		"OTHER:0"
}

Add a 'priority' option to your configured audio outputs:

audio_output {
	type            "alsa"
	name            "My ALSA Device"
	device          "hw:0,0"
	priority        "FIFO:32"
}

You can play with the priority settings "FIFO:xx" to get the optimal settings for your
device and setup.
